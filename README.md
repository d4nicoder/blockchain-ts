# Blockchain approach in typescript

This is a simple blockchain implementation written in typescript. I am not an expert in blockchain technology, therefore everything you see here could be poorly implemented or not safe for production environments.

My motivation ðŸ’ª for writing this code is to learn about this technology and its different ways of implementing it in other products.

## Testing on local json database

By default this code uses a local repository based on json objects. If you want to store data in the blockchain run this:

```bash
yarn start -m "Your message to store"

# Using NPM
npm start -m "Your message to store"
```

The blockchain will be stored in __./database/blockchain.json__

## Testing on CouchDB database

If you want to test on a CouchDB database, yo have to provide the database settings in the __.env__ file:

### **`REPOSITORY`**
This variable needs to be **couchdb** in order to use this database repository

### **`COUCH_DB_HOST`**
This is mandatory. Host address or IP of the database server

### **`COUCH_DB_PROTOCOL`**
This is mandatory. Only allowed **http** or **https**

### **`COUCH_DB_PORT`**
This is mandatory. Database listening port

### **`COUCH_DB_USER`**
This is optional. Only required if authentication is enabled

### **`COUCH_DB_PASS`**
This is optional. Only required if authentication is enabled

### **`COUCH_DB_DATABASE`**
This is mandatory. The name of the database. If not exists in the server, it will be created.
