# Blockchain approach in typescript

This is a simple blockchain implementation written in typescript. I am not an expert in blockchain technology, therefore everything you see here could be poorly implemented or not safe for production environments.

My motivation ðŸ’ª for writing this code is to learn about this technology and its different ways of implementing it in other products.
